# RESTful-API
 In this project i get a chance to explore RESTful API

so basically 
    -Restful api are web service architecture which works on HTTP protocol.
    -we use URL to access the resources and use HTTP protocol to manipulate them.

HTTP methods :-
    -GET  is use to retrive data from resource.
    -POST is use to create new resource.
    -PUT is use to overwrite over a resource.
    -PATCH is use to update an existing resource.
    -DELETE is use to delete a resource.
    -HEAD is use to retrive data from head port of the resource.

working :-
    -client sends a requests to server through HTTP methods than
    -server performs the tasks as per client requests.
